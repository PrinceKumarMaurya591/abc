    To check if an ArrayList contains a subsequence, you can follow the following approach in Java:


Explanation:
1. We define a class named `SubsequenceCheck` to encapsulate the code related to checking if an ArrayList contains a subsequence.
2. The `containsSubsequence` method takes two ArrayLists (`list` and `subsequence`) as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the `list` contains the given `subsequence`.
3. We initialize variables `listSize` and `subSize` to store the sizes of the `list` and `subsequence`, respectively.
4. We initialize variables `listIndex` and `subIndex` to keep track of the current indices while traversing the `list` and `subsequence`.
5. We enter a while loop that continues as long as there are elements remaining in both the `list` and `subsequence`.
6. Inside the loop, we compare the elements at the current indices of the `list` and `subsequence`.
7. If the elements are equal, we increment the `subIndex` to move to the next element in the `subsequence`.
8. In each iteration, we always increment the `listIndex` to move forward in the `list`.
9. After traversing the `list` or the `subsequence` (or both), we check if the `subIndex` is equal to the `subSize`.
10. If `subIndex` is equal to `subSize`, it means all elements of the `subsequence` have been found in the `list`, and we return `true`.
11. If the loop ends without finding the complete `subsequence`, we return `false`.
12. In the `main` method, we create an ArrayList named `list` with sample elements.
13. We create two different subsequences (`subsequence1` and `subsequence2`) to test the `containsSubsequence` method.
14. We call the `containsSubsequence` method for each subsequence and print the result using `System.out.println()`.

This code checks if an ArrayList contains a subsequence by iteratively comparing the elements of the `list` and the `subsequence`. It moves through both lists simultaneously, incrementing indices based on matches. If the `subsequence` is fully matched, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
