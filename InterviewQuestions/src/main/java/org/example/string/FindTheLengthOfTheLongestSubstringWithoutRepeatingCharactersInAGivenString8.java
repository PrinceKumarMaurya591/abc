    Certainly! Here's an example implementation in Java to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string:



Explanation:
1. We define a class named `LongestSubstring` to encapsulate the code related to finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
2. The `lengthOfLongestSubstring` method takes a string `s` as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
3. We initialize variables `i` and `j` to keep track of the start and end indices of the current substring.
4. We also initialize a `HashSet` called `set` to store unique characters encountered in the current substring.
5. We iterate using the `while` loop until both `i` and `j` reach the end of the string `s`.
6. If the current character at index `j` is not present in the `set`, it means it is a unique character. We add it to the `set`, increment `j`, and update the `maxLength` if necessary.
7. If the current character at index `j` is already present in the `set`, it means we have encountered a repeating character. We remove the character at index `i` from the `set`, increment `i`, and continue the process.
8. After the loop ends, we return the `maxLength`, which represents the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
9. In the `main` method, we provide an example string `"abcabcbb"`.
10. We call the `lengthOfLongestSubstring` method with the given string and store the result in the `length` variable.
11. Finally, we print the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

The code uses a sliding window approach to find the longest substring without repeating characters. It keeps track of the start and end indices of the current substring and updates the `maxLength` whenever a longer substring is found.
